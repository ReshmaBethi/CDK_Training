Queue:
1. We have to take an array Q[].
2.There should be 2 pointers front and rear(Both are initialized with -1)
3. We should store the array length in another variable(eg. MAX)
4.Enque():
     -if rear==MAX-1 then display a message that Queue is full
     -else increment the rear value and enque the element into the queue.
5.Dequeue():
      -if front==rear then display a message that Queue is empty
      -else increment the front and delete the item from the queue.
